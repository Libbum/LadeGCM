The solver listed in the source is [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt): the codebase of which is under EPL.
As we do not include the solver in this repository, there is no need to distribute this license here. EPL is compatible with MIT for this use case, APACHE should be fine, but please refer to a professional about that (GPL for instance is not).
One is welcomed to use an alternate solver to suit their needs as the [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) framework integrates with [several](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/0.18/installation.html#getting-solvers).
Please remain aware of the licensing restrictions for each, as many license choices in this domain are incompatible.
