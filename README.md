Around half of the carbon that humans emit into the atmosphere each year is taken up on land (by trees) and in the ocean (by absorption).
Lade *et al.* construct a simple model of carbon uptake that, unlike the complex models that are usually used, can be analysed mathematically.
Results of this model show that changes in atmospheric carbon may affect future carbon uptake more than changes in climate.
This simple model could also study mechanisms that are currently too uncertain for complex models.
